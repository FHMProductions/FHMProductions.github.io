                        Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect
                        about you.</p>

                            We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and
                            feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends,

                            integrate the services you use. We also test and analyse certain new

                    We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.

                    <strong>Your Choices:</strong>
                    You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of
                    your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or
                    restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured,

                    requests. You can exercise some of the choices by contacting us via our
                    Contact Us section below. Where the Services are administered for you by an
                    administrator (see “Notice to End Users” below), you may need to contact your
                    administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may
                    contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
                    Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if
                    fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you
                    ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law
                    or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved
                    concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in
                    the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were
                    infringed.

                        request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you

                        contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any
                        processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out

                        as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to

                <p class="description">Our products are intended for both personal use and use by TV Production
                    Companies. Where the Services are made available to you through an
                    organisation (e.g. your employer), that organisation is the administrator of the
                    Services and is responsible for the end-users and/or Service sites over which it
                    has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your
                    administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organisation’s
                    policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an
                    administrator’s organisation, which may be different than this policy.
                    Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organisation, if
                    you are a member of a team administered by an organisation, or if you use an
                    email address provided by an organisation (such as your work email address)
                    to access the Services, then the administrator of that team or the owner of the
                    domain associated with your organisational email address (e.g. your employer)
                    may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at

                    Account administrators are able to restrict your access to and privileges within
                    the account the administrator controls. In some cases, enterprise

                    If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your
                    account or use of the Services, you should deactivate your membership with
                    the relevant Account. Once an administrator asserts control over your account
                    or use of the Services, you may no longer be able to withdraw membership or
                    change the email address associated with your account without administrator
                    approval.

                    policies for more information.

                <p class="description">
                    The Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly
                    collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that
                    a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps
                    to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us
                    with personal information, please contact our support services.
                    Changes to our Privacy Policy
                    We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy
                    policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide
                    a more prominent notice by adding a notice on the Services homepages, login
                    screens, or by emailing you a notification. We will also keep prior
                    versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We encourage you
                    to review our privacy policy whenever you use the Services to stay informed
                    about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
                    If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, you will need to stop
                    using the Services and deactivate your account, as outlined above.
